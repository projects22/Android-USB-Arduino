# Android-USB-Arduino
Interfacing Arduino from Android via USB and OTG cable.
Android app in MIT App Inventor.
I have similar project  https://github.com/projects22/Arduino-io2 . Android app is in B4A (Basic for Android) https://www.b4x.com/

Folder "arduino_USB_OTG_2" is a new version using SerialUSB extention by https://github.com/rkl099/Appinventor-SerialOTGp3 . This extension works with Arduino Nano and Uno with CH341 USB to serial chip.
